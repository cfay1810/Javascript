    A program needs to calculate the Body Mass Index (BMI) for a person
    using their height in inches and weight in pounds. The program
    should prompt the user for weight and height
    The BMI calculation for this is 
    
    bmi = (weight / (height * height)) * 703
    
    based on the accepted calculation.
    
    If the BMI is between 18.5 and 25, display that the person is
    at a normal weight. If they are out of that range, tell them 
    to consult their doctor.
